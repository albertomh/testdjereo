# testdjereo developer README

## Git principles

This repo follows trunk-based development. This means:

- the `main` branch should always be in a releasable state
- use short-lived feature branches

## Justfile recipes

### The runserver recipe

The `runserver` just recipe is the main command to call when developing testdjereo.
It installs dependencies and the application (in editable mode) in a virtual environment,
then invokes Django's `runserver` using Python in [Development Mode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/devmode.html).
Python's Dev Mode will show warnings (Deprecation, Import, Resource) that are otherwise hidden.

### Use project metadata in the running application

`testdjereo/__init__.py` exposes project metadata such as version and author information.
To use it in a view:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

from testdjereo import __version__


def view(request):
    return HttpResponse(f"testdjereo v{__version__}")
```

### Use IPython as your shell

`IPython`, an improved Python shell, is installed as a development dependency. Django picks
it up by default and uses it instead of the default Python shell.
To use `IPython` run `manage.py shell` or the `just shell` recipe.

By default IPython's debugger (`ipdb`) will launch when a `breakpoint()` is reached while
running the application.
`ipdb` is also used to debug tests and will launch when a test fails.

## Developer tools

The project comes with some ready-to-use developer tools installed as dev dependencies and
configured for use locally:

- [django-browser-reload](https://pypi.org/project/django-browser-reload/): reload the browser
  when project files change.
- [django-debug-toolbar](https://pypi.org/project/django-debug-toolbar/): display information
  about the request/response cycle on each page.
- [rich](https://pypi.org/project/rich/): nicer formatting and colours for `runserver` logs.

## Checks and git hooks

`ruff` is configured as a pre-commit git hook to lint and format your code. Check the
`tool.ruff.lint` table in `pyproject.toml` for a full list of rules and options.
Notable rules include:

- [banned-api](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/banned-api/) from the `flake8-tidy-imports`
linter. Configured to ban importing the project settings module directly, preferring to use
`django.conf.settings`. This is to improve consistency, particulary when overriding
settings in tests.

## Upgrade checklist

- [ ] Bump the version of Django specified in the config for the `django-upgrade` hook in
      `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
