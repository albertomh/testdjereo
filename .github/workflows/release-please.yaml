# Release Please pipeline
# Refreshes a pull request that updates the changelog & bumps the Semantic Version every
# time the `main` branch is merged to.
#
# N.B. conventional commits (as enforced by the relevant git hook) are a prerequisite for
# Release Please to generate changelogs and calculate new SemVer tags.
#
# IMPORTANT!
# The following click-ops step must be taken to allow Release Please to make changes to
# your repo.
# 1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the following permissions:
#    ```text
#    contents: write
#    pull-requests: write
#    ```
# 2. Use the PAT to populate a GitHub Actions secret called `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` (under
#    `github.com/<user>/<repo>/settings/secrets/actions`).
