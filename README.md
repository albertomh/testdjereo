# testdjereo

## Prerequisites

To use `testdjereo` the following must be available locally:

- [Python 3.12](https://docs.python.org/3.12/) or above
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just)

## Quickstart: run locally

A `justfile` defines common development tasks. Run `just` to show all available recipes.

```sh
# create a dotenv and populate it with values for local development
cp .env.in .env

# install dependencies in a virtual environment and run the Django development server
just runserver
```

IPython is available as the default shell. Start an interactive session with:

```sh
just shell
```

## Develop

### djereo

`testdjereo` has been generated using the [djereo](https://github.com/albertomh/djereo)
project template.

To update `testdjereo` to a newer version of `djereo`:

```sh
cd ~/Projects/testdjereo/
uvx copier update --skip-answered --trust [--vcs-ref=<TAG>]
```

If the `--vcs-ref` flag is not specified, `copier` will use the latest `djereo` tag.

### Development prerequisites

In addition to the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) above, you will need the following to
develop `testdjereo`:

- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

### Managing settings

`environs` is used to load values from a `.env` file for use as settings. For safety this
behaviour is disabled during testing, with settings falling back to sensible defaults.
A `.env.in` template file should be used to generate the local `.env` used during development.
`.env` is listed in `.gitignore` as it should never be tracked in verion control.

### Dependency management

Dependencies are defined in the `pyproject.toml` file, with exact versions captured by a
`uv.lock` lockfile. `uv` is used to manage dependencies:

```sh
# add a dependency to the project
uv add some-package
```

Dependabot is configured to run weekly and update Python packages (minor & patch) and
GitHub Actions. See [.github/dependabot.yaml](.github/dependabot.yaml).

### Logging

`testdjereo` uses [structlog](https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/) for structured logging.
The logging configuration is defined in `logging.py`. Use the `configure_logging` function
to set up logging when the application starts:

```python
import structlog

from testdjereo.logging import configure_logging

configure_logging()

logger = structlog.get_logger()
logger.info("testdjereo running", key="value")
```

### Style

Code style is enforced by pre-commit hooks. Linter rules are configured in the `ruff`
tables in `pyproject.toml`.

```sh
# before you start developing, install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

Docstrings should follow the conventions set out in the [Google styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).

Please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
guidelines when writing commit messages. `commitlint` is enabled as a pre-commit hook.
Valid commit types are defined in `.commitlintrc.ts`.

## Test

Django's test runner (using the standard library's `unittest`) is used for the suite of
unit tests. Run all tests and report on code coverage:

```sh
just test [<expression>]

# eg. to only run tests inside the `test_migrations` module
just test tests.test_migrations
```

## Release

[Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) is used to automate:

- Updating the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
- Calculating the new SemVer tag based on conventional commit types.
- Creating a new GitHub release.

Release Please is configured as a GitHub action ([release-please.yaml](.github/workflows/release-please.yaml)).
It keeps a release pull request open that is refreshed as changes are merged into `main`.
To cut a release, simply merge the release pull request.

### GitHub Personal Access Token

In order for Release Please to automate the above process, a GitHub Actions secret called
`RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` must exist in GitHub (under testdjereo/settings/secrets/actions).
The contents of this secret must be a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the following permissions:

```text
contents: write
pull-requests: write
```

For more information, consult the [release-please-action project](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action).
